            <h3>"Flakes" marked my first step into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</h3>
            <h3>Since it was originally supposed to be a shower of snowflakes I named it "classes Flakes' and the name just stuck.</h3>
            <h3>The project uses classes to create multiple falling circles each with random sizes and color.</h3>
            <h3>By tweaking their starting points and adding extra elements, I created a shower of circles or "Flakes".</h3>
